# Password_Generator
 a simple project to generate a strong password

 This was one of my first python projects. It guarentees a STRONG generated password by ensuring use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
 The concept is straightforward, but I am including this on GitHub to show how I think through problems, even if my initial code isn't the prettiest to look at.
